How to run the program
======================

1. cd to this directory
2. $ make  			# compile
3. $ ./p2 fimename		# parse the file, make the AST, standardize the tree and run it in CSE machine
3. $ ./p2 -ast filename		# print the AST
4. $ ./p2 -debug filename	# print the AST, standardized AST and the controler structure while running the program

Structrue
=========
. 		makefile, readme, p2
./bin 		stores all the .o files
./src 		stores all the source code
./tests 	stores all the original test files and some other cases

BUGS
====
This interpreter can not run medium well, but it can run most of the test files correctly in the first project.
